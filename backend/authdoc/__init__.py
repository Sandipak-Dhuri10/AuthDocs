AuthDoc Django Project Initialization
-------------------------------------
This file marks the 'authdoc' directory as a Python package and ensures
that Django can properly import the project’s modules.

You can also import global signals or configurations here if needed.

# Example: If you had global signals, you could import them here
# from . import signals
